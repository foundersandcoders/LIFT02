Read through the ARCHITECTURE.md and FUNCTIONAL.md files get to grips with the project
My task is to create a component that displays:

- A section header
- A question
- an input for the user to answer the question
- an additional input for the user to declare 'actions'
- a skip button
- a submit button
  Don't do any styling, I will handle that later. I just want a template component that I can edit.
  Do you have any questions for me regarding the task? If not, please suggest some code for me
