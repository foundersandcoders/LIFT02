### Your Data, Your Choice

Workwise puts you in complete control of your workplace passport:

- **All responses start as private** - nothing is shared unless you explicitly make it public
- **Change visibility anytime** - toggle between public and private for any response or action
- **Delete freely** - remove any response or action you no longer want
- **Preview before sending** - always see exactly what will be shared
- **No automatic sharing** - emails are only sent when you click send

### Data Storage

Your workplace passport data is securely stored and only accessible to you. When you share your passport via email, only the items marked as "public" are included in the email to your line manager.

### Getting Help

Access context-sensitive help anytime by clicking the **'i' button** in the footer. The help content will adapt based on what you're currently viewing in the application.
